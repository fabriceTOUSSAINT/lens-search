# âš¡ WIP: Lens Searching âš¡

## ðŸ’­ What is it?
An Server Side Rendering application using Nodejs/Express, React, Redux, Flickr Api, Webpack, and more.
Users will be able to visit this application, search for a camera lens ( ex: XF23mmF1.4 ) and the application will search Flickr and 500px API for photos shot with searched lens by using EXIF data. Display returned data images, with more information pull about the lens from the EXIF the application will then search for reviews on that lens, suggest vendors to purchase the lens.
